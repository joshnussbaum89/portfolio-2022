        For those of you just visiting, I&apos;ve spent my life pursuing music
        as a professional guitarist. It wasn&apos;t until recently that I felt
        compelled to learn more and create more. I&apos;m now exploring new ways
        of making stuff, on browsers mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Websites and web apps are incredibly fun to make, and the creation
        process in a lot of ways, feels like making music.

        There are lots of ways to make websites now â€” Wix, Wordpress and
        Squarespace to name a few, all provide amazing flexibility and are a
        perfect solution for many people. However, some might prefer a higher
        level of creative control over how they present themselves and their
        business to the world. Some may even prefer a completely unique
        platform, one that is truly customizable and curated from their vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to make things that are a little different, but still feel
        intuitive and accessible. I use modern technology to create lighting
        fast websites that have great SEO by default.

        I think artists and creators should feel supported in as many ways as
        possible to do their best work. My goal is to help artists accomplish
        their creative dreams by creating a web experience that supports them.
